As seen above, users can open and move the files around in the workspace. They can also search for words with the files itself. If the searched word appears in any of the open files, the word will be highlited. If the searched word appears in another unopened file, the file name will be highlighted. In the demonstration above, this functionality is used to link Masood Yaser's involvement in multiple reported cases.

As seen above, users can open and move the files around in the workspace. They can also search for words with the files itself. If the searched word appears in any of the open files, the word will be highlited. If the searched word appears in another unopened file, the file name will be highlighted. In the demonstration above, this functionality is used to link Masood Yaser's involvement in multiple reported cases.

Using python NLP libraries such as nltk and spacy, I extracted all of the locations that appears in the reports. The location names are automatically emphasized when users choose the location functionality. Moreover, a world map(created with d3js) appers on the screen and the users can see where a specific location is.

Report Date: 1 April, 2003. CIA [From M15]:----- On 30 March, 2003 the British Special Branch arrested Omar Bakri Qatada at his home at #11 St. Mary's Terrace, Addington, London. Found in Qatada's bedroom was a small carton holding 10 ounces of Pentaerythritol [PETN] and Triacetone Triperoxide [TATP]. This is the same explosive that Richard Reid attempted to use on American Airlines #63 from Paris to Miami on 22 December, 2001. The BSB were alerted to follow and detain Qatada on the basis of information obtained from a respected moderate Moslem cleric in London, whose name was not provided in this report from M15.

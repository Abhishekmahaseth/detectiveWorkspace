Report Date 16 April, 2003. FBI: Special Report: ----- In Seattle. Washington on 15 Apr 1, 2003 a US Post Office on Howell St. reported that six identical packages, each marked "Home Made Candies", were sent to state government officials in Seattle. Each one had the return address: 1635 Alder St, Seattle, Washington. A check by an alert postal employee revealed that there is no such address in Seattle. This employee also stated that she believed the sender was a Middle Eastern man who paid in cash for the postage. The packages were given to the Seattle police who treated them as if they might be package bombs, which indeed they were. They were set off in a vacant field managed by the police for such purposes.
